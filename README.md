<!-- BLACKBOX PROJECT -->

The idea here was to make an ingredient generator for "black box" cooking challenges, where contestants are given a specified number of random ingredients and must use them to concoct a dish, with a little humour thrown in.

The current version of this project has limited functionality and serves as a "proof of concept". 


<!-- NOTES TO FUTURE ME -->
-incorporate a database so that users can submit new ingredients 
-use ingredient name attributes as route paramter to generate page for each ingredient with image, name, description
-wikipedia links? APIs?
